# Build ARPA

This is the primary developer journey. Start with the smallest executable surface that matches your role, then expand only when the required governance semantics demand it.

## Fastest paths

| Goal | Start here | What you should produce |
|---|---|---|
| Run the repository locally | [Quickstart](quickstart.md) | Passing schema, vector and service checks |
| Stand up a pilot | [15-minute quickstart](implementation-accelerator/01-15-minute-quickstart.md) | Pilot-readiness evidence |
| Choose an implementation shape | [Implementation selection guide](implementation-selection-guide.md) | Explicit supported modules/profiles |
| Implement from the specification | [Implementor guide](implementor-guide.md) | Protocol-conformant behaviour |
| Use TypeScript/Node.js | [TypeScript implementation](typescript-implementation.md) | TypeScript conformance and interoperability evidence |
| Understand the supplied Python service | [Reference implementation architecture](reference-implementation-architecture.md) | Reference service understanding, not normative behaviour |

## Machine-readable sources developers should prefer

- [`schemas/`](../schemas/README.md) for validation contracts;
- [`registries/`](../registries/README.md) for governed values and codes;
- [`openapi/`](../openapi/) for HTTP surface definitions;
- [`asyncapi/`](../asyncapi/) for event contracts;
- [`conformance/test-vectors/`](../conformance/test-vectors/) for executable behavioural expectations.

Do not copy constants or behavioural assumptions from another implementation when a normative artifact or conformance vector exists.

## TypeScript developer path

```bash
cd typescript
npm install
npm run release-check
```

To run the local TypeScript HTTP service:

```bash
npm run network-server
```

The TypeScript implementation is deliberately repository-artifact driven and behaviourally independent from the Python reference implementation.

## Next

After local implementation succeeds, continue to [Assure](assure.md) before treating the implementation as interoperable or release-ready.
