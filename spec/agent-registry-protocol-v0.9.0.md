# Agent Registry Protocol and Architecture (ARPA)

## A Distributed Authority-Control Plane for Delegated Action

**Category:** Standards Track  
**Intended Status:** Candidate Specification  
**Version:** 0.9.0  
**Date:** 2026-07-16  
**Author:** Sankarshan Mukhopadhyay

## Status of This Memo

This document is the authoritative Candidate Specification for Agent Registry Protocol and Architecture (ARPA) v0.9.0. It consolidates the architecture, normative protocol requirements, conformance targets, extension boundaries, implementation contracts, and evidence expectations into a single specification surface.

This document is not an adopted standard and does not claim certification, accreditation, legal recognition, formal cryptographic review, or production security approval. Normative requirements define behavior necessary for the applicable conformance target. Explanatory text, implementation notes, examples, deployment patterns, and appendices are informative unless a section explicitly states otherwise.

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **NOT RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14) (RFC 2119, RFC 8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here. Use of these terms does not imply IETF process or endorsement; they are adopted here solely as a precise, widely understood requirements vocabulary.

## Abstract

This document specifies an architecture, information model, protocol surface, processing model, lifecycle framework, security architecture, governance model, and conformance requirements for registries of software agents that act on behalf of principals.

The specification is founded on the proposition that an agent registry is not merely a directory of autonomous software objects. It is a distributed authority-control plane for delegated action. A registry conforming to this specification therefore makes separate but linked claims about agent identity, software version, operational deployment, control, accountability, delegated authority, capability, assurance, runtime state, governance, and redress.

The protocol is designed to help a relying party answer four progressively stronger questions:

1. **Identification:** What agent is this, and is it the same logical agent previously encountered?
2. **Attribution:** Who operates, controls, sponsors, governs, or accepts responsibility for it?
3. **Authorization:** Why may this agent perform this particular action, for this principal, under these conditions?
4. **Accountability:** What evidence exists, what institution governs the action, and how can an error or harm be challenged and repaired?

The specification defines persistent identity and lineage, typed relationships, authority envelopes, delegation chains, capability and assurance records, multidimensional status, point-in-time resolution, authority and reliance evaluation, execution evidence, registry federation, explicit recognition, privacy-preserving resolution, governance, appeal, and conformance profiles.

---

## Document Conventions

This draft uses four kinds of text:

- **Normative requirements** contain requirements terms and define conformance behavior.
- **Rationale** explains the design problem or failure mode addressed by a requirement.
- **Implementation notes** describe non-exclusive implementation approaches.
- **Examples** illustrate behavior but do not override normative language.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, examples use JSON and HTTP for readability. The architecture is transport-independent and proof-format-independent.

---

## Candidate Specification Control

This document is the sole authoritative prose specification for ARPA v0.9.0. Schemas, controlled registries, OpenAPI and AsyncAPI descriptions, conformance vectors, implementation reports, and evidence bundles are subordinate machine-readable artifacts. Where an inconsistency is found, implementations MUST fail safely, record the conflict, and open a specification defect rather than infer an affirmative authority decision.

### Normative and informative content

Sections 12 through 37 are normative except where marked as rationale, example, implementation note, deployment guidance, or informative interoperability material. Sections 1 through 11 establish the architectural and authority model and are normative where they use BCP 14 requirement terms. Appendices are informative unless a requirement explicitly incorporates an appendix item.

### Conformance targets

ARPA defines the following independently claimable conformance targets:

- Registry publisher
- Registry consumer or resolver
- Authority evaluator
- Event publisher
- Event consumer or enforcement point
- Proof verifier
- Policy adapter
- Federation participant
- ARPA–TRQP projection adapter

An implementation MUST declare each target it claims, the profiles and versions implemented, its known deviations, and the evidence supporting the claim. Conformance to one target MUST NOT be presented as conformance to another.

### Stable Candidate requirements

The following requirement identifiers anchor the Candidate Specification. Detailed requirements in later sections refine these controls and are traceable through the conformance manifests.

| ID | Candidate requirement | Primary target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ARPA-CAND-001 | Implementations MUST distinguish identity, authority, assurance, proof validity, registry operation, and lifecycle status. | Registry, consumer |
| ARPA-CAND-002 | Delegation MUST NOT expand the issuer's effective scope. | Authority evaluator |
| ARPA-CAND-003 | Recognition MUST be scoped, current, withdrawable, and non-transitive unless explicitly declared. | Registry, evaluator |
| ARPA-CAND-004 | Technical federation MUST NOT imply governance recognition or authority transfer. | Federation participant |
| ARPA-CAND-005 | Revocation MUST produce durable evidence and MUST NOT be considered converged until applicable enforcement acknowledgements exist. | Publisher, consumer, enforcement point |
| ARPA-CAND-006 | Unknown, conflicting, stale, unsupported, or unavailable authority MUST resolve to deny or indeterminate and MUST NOT result in implicit allow. | Evaluator |
| ARPA-CAND-007 | Events MUST be persistently sequenceable, replayable, deduplicated, and processable idempotently. | Event publisher, consumer |
| ARPA-CAND-008 | Proof validity MUST NOT be interpreted as authority validity. | Proof verifier, evaluator |
| ARPA-CAND-009 | Policy decisions MUST retain policy version, evaluated inputs, outcome, reason codes, conditions, prohibitions, and evidence references. | Policy adapter |
| ARPA-CAND-010 | Capability and conformance claims MUST be machine-readable, versioned, and evidence-bounded. | Implementation |
| ARPA-CAND-011 | ARPA–TRQP projection support MUST be declared independently from ARPA and TRQP conformance. | Projection adapter |
| ARPA-CAND-012 | A query projection MUST preserve scope and MUST NOT produce an affirmative result for revoked, suspended, expired, stale, conflicting, or unresolved authority. | Projection adapter |

### Artifact authority and traceability

Every objectively testable normative requirement MUST map to at least one test or inspection procedure and an expected evidence output. Machine-readable artifacts MUST identify their specification version and governing authority. Extensions MUST use a registered namespace, declare version and authority, and MUST NOT redefine a core field or weaken a fail-safe requirement.

# 1. Introduction

Software agents increasingly act with varying degrees of autonomy across digital systems. They retrieve information, negotiate with services, invoke tools, access protected data, initiate transactions, coordinate subordinate agents, and generate outputs that may materially affect people and institutions.

A conventional service registry can identify a network location and describe a set of functions. That model is insufficient when an agent acts under delegated authority.

For delegated action, a relying party needs to determine:

- which agent is involved;
- whether the presented agent is the same logical agent previously encountered;
- which runtime or deployment is currently executing;
- who operates, controls, sponsors, or is accountable for the agent;
- which principal authorized the action;
- which action classes, resources, purposes, limits, and prohibitions apply;
- whether further delegation is permitted;
- which capabilities were declared, tested, or independently assured;
- whether the current deployment remains within the scope of applicable assurance;
- whether the agent or its authority has been suspended, restricted, compromised, revoked, retired, or superseded;
- what evidence exists for a particular action;
- which governance framework applies; and
- how an affected party may challenge, appeal, or obtain redress.

This specification defines a registry architecture capable of answering those questions.

The registry is not required to store all underlying evidence, confidential delegation terms, or operational telemetry directly. It is required to provide authoritative, policy-aware, and verifiable resolution paths to those materials and to communicate their current status, provenance, and applicability.

The architectural objective is therefore not universal trust certification. It is machine-resolvable reliance.

---

# 2. Problem Statement

## 2.1 From Service Discovery to Delegated Action

Traditional registries and service catalogs generally answer a bounded set of questions: what a service is called, where it can be reached, which protocol it supports, and which organization publishes it. Those answers are useful for routing and discovery. They are insufficient when a software agent can cause effects in the world on behalf of another party.

An agent may access protected records, recommend or determine eligibility, prepare a transaction, submit a transaction, alter a workflow, instruct another agent, or exercise a permission originally granted to a human or institution. In those circumstances, the relying party needs to understand not merely the agent's advertised functionality, but the institutional and technical basis on which the proposed action may be accepted.

A directory entry can state that an agent supports `purchase.submit`. It cannot, by that statement alone, establish that the agent may submit purchase order 456 for principal P, in India, before a particular expiry time, below a stated monetary ceiling, after obtaining an approval, while avoiding prohibited suppliers. The missing information is not descriptive metadata. It is bounded authority.

## 2.2 The Four Registry Questions

A registry intended for delegated action MUST be capable of supporting four distinct classes of resolution:

| Function | Question | Typical Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identification | What agent is this? | Identifier, key binding, version, deployment, lineage |
| Attribution | Who stands behind or controls it? | Operator, controller, accountable entity, governance relationships |
| Authorization | Why may it perform this action? | Authority envelope, delegation chain, approvals, policy decision |
| Accountability | How can the act be examined or repaired? | Receipts, evidence, incident records, appeal and redress routes |

These functions are cumulative but not interchangeable. An agent can be identified without being authorized. An operator can be attributable without accepting liability for every action. An assurance provider can verify controls without granting authority. A valid delegation can exist while the runtime is compromised or the assurance has expired.

## 2.3 Structural Risks Addressed by This Specification

This specification addresses recurring failure modes in agent infrastructure:

- treating registration as evidence of trustworthiness;
- treating control of a key or registry record as authority to act;
- treating an advertised capability as permission;
- allowing authority to persist after a change of principal, controller, operator, or deployment;
- applying assurance obtained for one version or environment to another;
- relying on current state when a dispute requires historical state;
- publishing revocation without ensuring that credentials, sessions, or subordinate delegations are disabled;
- allowing opaque federation to create accidental transitive trust;
- providing no protocol-visible route for correction, appeal, or redress; and
- relying on stale projections without disclosing their age or provenance.

## 2.4 Registry Role in the Control Loop

The registry defined here is not assumed to execute every action itself. It participates in a wider control loop:

```text
Identity and relationship resolution
              |
              v
Authority and reliance evaluation
              |
              v
Policy decision and required approvals
              |
              v
Runtime policy enforcement
              |
              v
Execution and evidence production
              |
              v
Status, audit, incident, and redress feedback
```

The registry establishes and resolves authoritative conditions of reliance. A Policy Decision Point evaluates those conditions against action context and relying-party policy. A Policy Enforcement Point controls actual execution. Evidence and status updates feed back into later decisions.

A registry that publishes authority but cannot communicate status changes to enforcement surfaces MAY conform only to lower profiles. It MUST NOT claim conformance to a delegated-authority or high-assurance profile unless the profile's enforcement and revocation requirements are met.

## 2.5 Desired Outcome

The desired outcome is not a universal list of trusted agents. Such a list would conceal differences in purpose, risk, jurisdiction, governance, assurance scope, and acceptable failure.

The desired outcome is a common protocol through which a relying party can determine whether the conditions for a particular act are satisfied, not satisfied, or indeterminate, and can obtain evidence explaining that determination.

# 3. Scope

## 3.1 In Scope

This specification defines requirements for:

- registration of persistent agent identifiers;
- representation of agent versions, deployments, and lineage;
- binding of agents to cryptographic keys and service endpoints;
- representation of developers, publishers, deployers, operators, controllers, sponsors, principals, accountable entities, assurance providers, governance authorities, and infrastructure providers;
- delegation and authority records;
- authority evaluation;
- capability declarations, verifications, and authorizations;
- assurance claims and conformance profiles;
- lifecycle, operational, security, and authority status;
- point-in-time state resolution;
- registry query and discovery interfaces;
- event publication and subscription;
- execution and decision receipts;
- federation and recognition between registries;
- governance and redress metadata;
- security, privacy, audit, and availability controls; and
- conformance testing.

## 3.2 Out of Scope

This specification does not define:

- a universal agent communication protocol;
- a universal task protocol;
- a universal ontology for every possible agent capability;
- a universal legal theory of agency;
- a universal liability regime;
- a mandatory distributed ledger implementation;
- a mandatory credential format;
- a mandatory cryptographic suite;
- a mandatory policy language;
- a universal reputation score;
- a universal definition of a “trusted agent”; or
- a requirement that all registry data be public.

Implementations MAY use distributed ledgers, transparency logs, conventional databases, content-addressed stores, confidential computing systems, federated databases, or combinations thereof, provided that the conformance and security requirements of this specification are met.

---

# 4. Use Cases

This section describes representative use cases used to derive and pressure-test the requirements. The examples are not exhaustive and do not mandate particular sectors.

## 4.1 Low-Risk Informational Agent

A research assistant publishes summaries from public sources. A relying party needs to resolve the agent's identifier, publisher, endpoints, supported protocols, current version, and retirement status. No transactional authority is exercised.

This use case motivates the Discovery Registry profile. It demonstrates that a lightweight registry remains valuable and that the higher-assurance features in this specification are progressive rather than universally mandatory.

## 4.2 Enterprise Workflow Agent

An enterprise agent reads restricted project records, creates tickets, and modifies workflow states. The enterprise must know which deployment is executing, which operator is responsible, which data-access capabilities are authorized, whether required assurance remains valid, and which actions were taken.

This use case requires typed relationships, deployment identity, structured capabilities, operational status, assurance, and execution receipts.

## 4.3 Procurement Agent with Bounded Spending Authority

A principal delegates to an agent the ability to prepare and submit purchases from approved suppliers. The delegation includes a per-transaction ceiling, an aggregate ceiling, a geographic scope, an expiry, prohibited related-party transactions, and a requirement for human approval above a threshold.

The agent later delegates only the supplier-validation step to a subordinate agent. The subordinate agent must not inherit submission authority or spending limits that are irrelevant to its task.

This use case requires authority envelopes, delegation narrowing, approval conditions, quantitative limits, downstream lineage, decision receipts, and cascade revocation.

## 4.4 Healthcare Data-Access Agent

An agent coordinates patient scheduling and retrieves limited clinical information. The agent may access data only for a declared care purpose and only through a deployment operating in an approved region. It may not make clinical decisions or expose records to a general-purpose subordinate agent.

This use case requires purpose limitation, data classification, jurisdiction and deployment constraints, explicit prohibitions, privacy-preserving status and authorization proofs, and evidence access controls.

## 4.5 Public-Service Eligibility Agent

An agent assists with public-benefit eligibility. Its output may materially affect access to an essential service. The governing institution requires independent assurance, explainable policy versions, human escalation, point-in-time reconstruction, appeal, correction, and continuity arrangements when the agent is suspended.

This use case requires the High-Assurance or Fiduciary profile. It demonstrates that redress and service continuity are part of system correctness rather than external administrative concerns.

## 4.6 Financial or Fiduciary Agent

An agent acts under duties to a principal or beneficiary. Its technical capability includes transfers, but its current authority permits only portfolio analysis and preparation of instructions. An interface that treats capability as permission could produce unauthorized movement of assets.

This use case requires strict separation of declared, verified, and authorized capabilities; explicit beneficiary and duty metadata; prohibited actions; and a strong enforcement boundary.

## 4.7 Change of Operator

An agent is transferred from one operator to another while retaining its persistent identifier. Existing assurance was based partly on the former operator's controls, and several principals have active delegations.

The registry must not silently carry all relationships forward. Each assurance claim and delegation must state whether it terminates, remains valid, enters review, or requires reissuance or novation.

## 4.8 Compromised Runtime

An agent's core registration remains valid, but a deployment key is compromised. The security authority quarantines the deployment, while another approved deployment remains available.

This use case demonstrates why registration, operational, security, authority, and assurance status are multidimensional and why restrictions may apply to a deployment rather than the entire logical agent.

## 4.9 Stale Projection

A discovery index reports an agent as active, but the authoritative status service suspended it two minutes earlier. A low-risk search result may tolerate the delay; a financial action may not.

This use case requires source provenance, projection lag, relying-party freshness policy, authoritative fallback, and `indeterminate` outcomes when current status cannot be established.

## 4.10 Conflicting Federation Status

One recognized registry reports an agent as active, while another reports it as suspended for the relevant jurisdiction. The local relying policy must determine precedence or return an indeterminate decision. Technical ability to read both records does not itself resolve institutional conflict.

## 4.11 Emergency Suspension, Appeal, and Restoration

A governance authority imposes an emergency suspension after a credible incident report. The operator contests the attribution. The registry preserves the suspension event, records the appeal, supports investigation, and later restores a restricted status after remediation.

This use case requires rapid containment, due process, historical preservation, structured reasons, restoration semantics, and subscriber notification.

## 4.12 End-to-End Delegated Action Flow

The common successful path is:

```text
1. Discover candidate agent
2. Resolve identity, version, deployment, and relationships
3. Verify registry and governance recognition
4. Resolve assurance and current multidimensional status
5. Resolve authority envelope and delegation lineage
6. Evaluate action-specific scope, limits, prohibitions, and approvals
7. Obtain required approvals
8. Issue a short-lived decision receipt
9. Enforce the decision at the execution boundary
10. Produce an execution receipt and supporting evidence
11. Publish material events and retain evidence for audit or redress
```

A conforming implementation MAY combine steps, but it MUST preserve the semantic distinctions and evidence required by its declared profile.

# 5. Requirements and Failure Modes

## 5.1 Requirement Matrix

| Requirement | Failure Mode Prevented | Required Profiles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Separate identity from authority | Registration or ownership is mistaken for permission | All |
| Persistent, non-reassignable identifiers | Historical acts become unattributable | All |
| Typed relationships | Developer, operator, controller, principal, and accountable entity collapse into one field | All, progressively stronger |
| Version and deployment binding | Assurance or authorization is applied to a materially different runtime | B-D |
| Authority envelopes | Delegated permission remains implicit, overbroad, or non-verifiable | C-D |
| Delegation narrowing | A subordinate agent expands authority | C-D |
| Multidimensional status | An active registration hides compromise, expiry, or operational restriction | B-D |
| Point-in-time resolution | A dispute cannot reconstruct state at execution time | B-D |
| Status freshness metadata | A relying party accepts stale suspension or revocation information | All |
| Decision and execution receipts | Authorization and execution cannot be reconstructed | B-D |
| Revocation propagation | Runtime access and subordinate authority survive registry revocation | C-D |
| Explicit recognition | Technical federation creates accidental transitive trust | Federated deployments |
| Contestability and redress | Erroneous or abusive registry action cannot be repaired | B-D |
| Privacy by resolution | Public registries expose principals, beneficiaries, or confidential delegation terms | All |

## 5.2 Functional Requirements

A conforming registry MUST provide authoritative resolution of agent identity and lifecycle status. Higher profiles MUST additionally provide structured relationships, versions, deployments, assurance, authority, evidence, and redress as defined later in this document.

The registry MUST distinguish statements that are self-declared from statements independently verified or issued by an authorized third party. A query response MUST permit a relying party to identify the issuer and scope of each material claim.

## 5.3 Interoperability Requirements

Interoperability has at least five dimensions:

1. **Syntactic interoperability:** systems can parse exchanged records.
2. **Semantic interoperability:** systems interpret fields and states consistently.
3. **Cryptographic interoperability:** systems can verify proofs and key bindings.
4. **Governance interoperability:** systems know whose records and decisions are recognized.
5. **Operational interoperability:** systems can meet freshness, event, revocation, and availability expectations.

A deployment claiming federation support MUST publish an interoperability declaration covering all five dimensions. Exchanging valid JSON is not sufficient evidence of registry interoperability.

## 5.4 Reviewability Requirements

A circulation-ready registry profile SHOULD document:

- its threat model;
- authoritative sources and derived projections;
- role separation;
- lifecycle state semantics;
- processing precedence;
- failure behavior;
- freshness targets;
- revocation propagation targets;
- appeal and redress procedures;
- privacy disclosures; and
- known limitations.

## 5.5 Fail-Closed and Fail-Open Behavior

Each profile and deployment MUST declare which operations fail closed, fail open, or enter an indeterminate state when required information is unavailable.

High-risk authority decisions SHOULD fail closed when current authority, security status, or required assurance cannot be established. Discovery and low-risk informational use MAY continue with warnings when policy permits.

An implementation MUST NOT convert missing evidence into an affirmative decision merely to preserve availability.

---

# 6. Design Principles

## 6.1 Identity Is Not Authority

A valid agent identifier MUST NOT be treated as authorization to perform an action.

## 6.2 Key Control Is Not Accountability

Proof of control over a key establishes possession or control of that key. It does not by itself establish legal responsibility, legitimacy, fitness, institutional authority, or fiduciary obligation.

## 6.3 Capability Is Not Permission

An agent’s technical ability, declared capability, verified competence, and delegated permission MUST be modeled as separate concepts.

## 6.4 Authority Is Contextual

Authority MUST be evaluated against the relevant principal, action, resource, purpose, time, jurisdiction, limits, prohibitions, approvals, and delegation chain.

## 6.5 Delegation Is Not Ownership

Transfer of an agent identifier, software artifact, or registry record MUST NOT silently transfer outstanding delegations.

## 6.6 Revocation Must Reach Enforcement Surfaces

Registry status changes MUST be capable of propagating to operational enforcement systems. A registry status flag without a defined enforcement path is insufficient for high-assurance use.

## 6.7 Assurance Is Bound to What Was Evaluated

Assurance MUST be bound to the relevant agent version, artifact, deployment profile, policy bundle, and evaluation scope.

## 6.8 Consequential Action Must Be Reconstructable

For actions within a conformance profile that requires evidence, the system MUST support reconstruction of the identity, authority, policy, approvals, evidence, and outcome that applied at the time of execution.

## 6.9 Registry Decisions Must Be Contestable

A conforming registry MUST provide governed mechanisms to correct, appeal, suspend, restore, and annotate registry decisions.

## 6.10 Derived State Must Disclose Freshness

Indexes, caches, replicas, and aggregators MUST communicate source provenance and freshness.

## 6.11 Federation Must Be Explicit

Trust or recognition between registries, authorities, assurance providers, and governance frameworks MUST be explicitly represented. It MUST NOT be inferred solely from technical interoperability.

## 6.12 Privacy by Resolution

A registry SHOULD reveal only the minimum information required for a relying decision. Confidential evidence and delegation terms SHOULD be resolved through authorized access or selective disclosure rather than broad publication.

---

# 8. Architectural Overview

## 8.1 Registry as a Distributed Control Plane

The term “registry” in this specification refers to a logical system, not necessarily a single database, contract, or administrative organization. A conforming registry may comprise authoritative record stores, status services, indexes, policy decision services, evidence custodians, event streams, governance authorities, and enforcement integrations.

The architecture is distributed because identity, delegation, assurance, operational status, governance, and evidence may have different legitimate issuers and storage requirements. It is an authority-control plane because its primary function is to make the conditions and boundaries of delegated action resolvable and enforceable.

## 8.2 Reference Architecture

## 8.4 Deployment Independence

This specification does not require all data to be co-located. A public identifier record may resolve to a protected authority record, a content-addressed description, an external assurance claim, and a confidential evidence store. The resolver is responsible for presenting enough provenance, status, and access information to support a policy decision.

## 8.5 Normative Boundary

A deployment conforms through observable protocol behavior, record semantics, processing rules, security properties, and declared profile support. It does not conform merely because it uses a particular database, ledger, credential technology, or agent-description format.

---

# 9. Trust and Authority Boundaries

## 9.1 General Model

No component in this architecture is universally trusted. Each actor is trusted only for claims within its authority and declared scope.

| Component or Role | Relied Upon For | Not Relied Upon For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Registry Operator | Publication and availability of registry state | Truth of every third-party claim |
| Registration Authority | Admission and identifier issuance under its policy | Agent capability or action authorization |
| Identifier Controller | Authorized updates within its control scope | Universal accountability |
| Delegation Issuer | Authority that the issuer is competent to grant | Authority beyond the issuer's own scope |
| Assurance Provider | Evaluation against declared controls and scope | Permission for a particular action |
| Governance Authority | Decisions within its governance domain | Recognition outside that domain |
| Index Operator | Search and projection | Final authoritative status |
| Policy Decision Point | Evaluation under a named policy version | Enforcement of the resulting decision |
| Policy Enforcement Point | Prevention or permission of execution | Truth of registry claims not independently verified |
| Runtime | Execution and receipt production | Self-asserted assurance or unconstrained authority |
| Relying Party | Local reliance policy and final acceptance decision | Modification of authoritative registry state |

## 9.2 Issuer Competence

A record is not acceptable solely because its proof verifies. The relying party MUST also determine whether the issuer was authorized or recognized to issue that record type for the relevant subject and scope.

For example, an operator may be permitted to update a service endpoint but not to name a new accountable entity. An assurance provider may issue a control-evaluation claim but not a delegation. A principal may delegate only authority it possesses.

## 9.3 Trust Chains and Authority Chains

Cryptographic verification chains and authority chains are related but distinct. A proof chain establishes the integrity and origin of records. An authority chain establishes that each delegation was within the delegator's competence and that scope narrowed appropriately.

Implementations MUST validate both where applicable.

## 9.4 Projection Boundary

Indexes and caches are untrusted for finality unless the relying policy explicitly accepts their freshness and proof model. A projection MAY support discovery, but consequential decisions MUST satisfy the profile's authoritative status requirements.

## 9.5 Enforcement Boundary

A registry record does not itself prevent execution. The Policy Enforcement Point is responsible for applying decisions to keys, sessions, APIs, tools, data, or transaction channels. High-assurance claims about revocation MUST include evidence of propagation or a disclosed maximum propagation interval.

## 9.6 Governance Boundary

Technical interoperability does not establish recognition. A relying domain decides which governance authorities, assurance providers, registries, and status decisions it accepts. Recognition MUST be represented explicitly and evaluated as part of reliance.

---

# 10. Logical Planes

## 10.1 Logical Planes

A conforming implementation MUST support the following logical planes, whether implemented as separate services or integrated components:

1. **Identity and Continuity Plane**
2. **Control and Accountability Plane**
3. **Delegation and Authority Plane**
4. **Capability and Assurance Plane**
5. **Operational State and Evidence Plane**
6. **Governance, Contestability, and Redress Plane**
7. **Query and Decision Plane**
8. **Event and Subscription Plane**

## 10.2 Separation of Concerns

Implementations MUST NOT use a single undifferentiated “owner” field as the exclusive representation of all relationships.

Implementations MUST distinguish at minimum:

- agent identity;
- current controller;
- current operator;
- accountable entity;
- principal;
- delegation;
- assurance provider; and
- governance authority.

## 10.3 Authoritative and Derived Data

An implementation MAY maintain different systems for authoritative state, discovery indexes, evidence storage, and operational telemetry.

Every query response derived from non-authoritative data MUST include sufficient provenance to identify:

- the authoritative source;
- the source version, sequence, checkpoint, or transaction;
- the projection update time;
- known lag or staleness; and
- the response generation time.

## 10.4 Public and Confidential Data

The architecture MUST support both public and access-controlled records.

The registry MUST NOT require publication of confidential delegation terms, personal data, proprietary model details, sensitive operational telemetry, or protected evidence.

Where data is withheld, the registry SHOULD publish:

- a stable reference;
- the record type;
- the issuer or authoritative source;
- the current status;
- a digest or commitment where appropriate;
- the access protocol;
- the disclosure policy; and
- sufficient metadata for policy evaluation.

---

# 11. Roles and Responsibilities

A conforming registry deployment MAY combine roles, but role boundaries MUST remain explicit.

## 11.1 Registration Authority

Validates registration requests and creates agent identifiers.

## 11.2 Registry Operator

Operates the authoritative registry services.

## 11.3 Governance Authority

Defines policy and adjudicates participation or enforcement decisions.

## 11.4 Identifier Controller

Controls updates to the core agent record.

## 11.5 Delegation Issuer

Creates authority envelopes.

## 11.6 Assurance Issuer

Creates assurance claims.

## 11.7 Status Authority

Publishes lifecycle, operational, security, or authority status.

## 11.8 Index Operator

Operates a projection or search service.

## 11.9 Evidence Custodian

Stores execution evidence, audit artifacts, or confidential supporting materials.

## 11.10 Resolver

Accepts identifier, status, authority, or reliance queries and returns structured responses.

## 11.11 Policy Decision Point

Evaluates a request against policy, authority, status, assurance, and contextual data.

## 11.12 Policy Enforcement Point

Prevents or permits execution based on a decision.

## 11.13 Appeal Authority

Accepts and adjudicates challenges, corrections, suspensions, or revocation appeals.

---

# 12. Identifier and Namespace Model

## 12.1 Agent Identifier Properties

An agent identifier MUST be:

- globally or federation-wide unique within its declared namespace;
- persistent across routine key rotation;
- resolvable to a current record or an explicit terminal status;
- non-reassignable after retirement or revocation;
- capable of representing lineage; and
- independent of a single network endpoint.

## 12.2 Identifier Syntax

This specification defines the generic URI scheme:

```text
agentreg:<registry-namespace>:<agent-local-id>
```

Example:

```text
agentreg:example.org:8f2b7b4a-6c2d-4ee5-94ac-5a3f6a95d314
```

The scheme is defined by the following ABNF ([RFC 5234](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5234)):

```abnf
agent-identifier  = "agentreg:" registry-namespace ":" agent-local-id
registry-namespace = 1*253( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." )
agent-local-id      = 1*255( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" / "." / ":" )
ALPHA               = %x41-5A / %x61-7A
DIGIT               = %x30-39
```

`registry-namespace` SHOULD be a DNS domain name or an equivalent registry-assigned namespace under the issuing Registration Authority's policy. `agent-local-id` MUST be unique within `registry-namespace` and MUST NOT be reassigned after retirement or revocation (§12.1). Implementations MAY support other identifier schemes. A conformance profile MUST declare supported identifier schemes. Registration of `agentreg` as a permanent URI scheme is an Open Issue (§40.1) and IANA Consideration (§41); until registered, the scheme MUST be treated as provisional and MUST NOT be assumed collision-free with any future IANA-registered scheme of the same name.

## 12.3 Version Identifier

Each materially distinct agent version MUST have a version identifier.

A version identifier SHOULD include or resolve to:

- semantic version;
- artifact digest;
- release timestamp;
- policy bundle identifier;
- model or model-family constraints, when applicable; and
- predecessor version.

## 12.4 Deployment Identifier

Each deployment in an accountable or higher conformance profile MUST have a unique deployment identifier.

## 12.5 Runtime Identifier

High-assurance deployments MUST support runtime identities capable of being cryptographically bound to workload attestations or equivalent integrity evidence.

## 12.6 Identifier Resolution

Resolution MUST return one of:

- `active_record`;
- `terminal_record`;
- `redirect_to_successor`;
- `not_found`;
- `not_authorized`;
- `temporarily_unavailable`; or
- `indeterminate`.

A registry MUST NOT return `not_found` for a known retired, revoked, burned, or superseded identifier.

---

# 13. Record and Relationship Model

## 13.1 Record Envelope

Every record defined by this specification MUST use a common envelope.

```json
{
  "record_id": "string",
  "record_type": "string",
  "schema_version": "string",
  "issuer": "string",
  "subject": "string or object",
  "issued_at": "date-time",
  "effective_from": "date-time",
  "effective_until": "date-time or null",
  "status": "string",
  "supersedes": ["record_id"],
  "evidence": ["reference"],
  "governance": ["reference"],
  "proof": {
    "type": "string",
    "verification_method": "string",
    "created": "date-time",
    "value": "string"
  }
}
```

## 13.2 Canonicalization

A conforming implementation MUST define a deterministic serialization or canonicalization method for records that are signed, hashed, or committed.

Unless a conformance profile declares an alternative, implementations MUST use [JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS), RFC 8785](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785) as the default canonicalization method for JSON-encoded records prior to hashing or signing. A profile MAY declare an alternative canonicalization method (for example, a CBOR deterministic encoding under [RFC 8949](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949) §4.2, or a JSON-LD/RDF dataset canonicalization) provided the method is deterministic, is identified in the record's `proof.type`, and is declared in the profile's conformance statement (§35.5).

## 13.3 Agent Core Record

The Agent Core Record MUST include:

- agent identifier;
- human-readable name or label;
- agent class;
- current registration status;
- current canonical version;
- current controller relationships;
- current operator relationships;
- accountable entity relationships;
- canonical description reference;
- service endpoint references;
- key references;
- lineage references;
- governance framework references;
- status endpoints;
- created time;
- last material update time; and
- authoritative source metadata.

Example:

```json
{
  "record_type": "agent_core",
  "agent_id": "agentreg:example.org:agent-123",
  "name": "Procurement Review Agent",
  "agent_class": "delegated_transactional_agent",
  "registration_status": "active",
  "current_version": "agent-version-2.4.1",
  "controllers": ["relationship-controller-1"],
  "operators": ["relationship-operator-1"],
  "accountable_entities": ["relationship-accountable-1"],
  "description": "https://registry.example.org/agents/agent-123/card",
  "service_endpoints": ["endpoint-1", "endpoint-2"],
  "keys": ["key-binding-1", "key-binding-2"],
  "lineage": {
    "predecessors": ["agentreg:example.org:agent-100"],
    "successors": []
  },
  "governance": ["governance-profile-financial-1"],
  "status_endpoints": [
    "https://registry.example.org/agents/agent-123/status"
  ],
  "created_at": "2026-07-15T00:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-07-15T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## 13.4 Relationship Record

A Relationship Record MUST express:

- subject;
- related entity;
- relationship type;
- scope;
- effective period;
- authority source;
- status;
- revocation semantics; and
- evidence or proof.

Supported base relationship types SHOULD include:

- `developed_by`;
- `published_by`;
- `deployed_by`;
- `operated_by`;
- `controlled_by`;
- `sponsored_by`;
- `accountable_to`;
- `assured_by`;
- `governed_by`;
- `hosted_by`;
- `acts_for`;
- `benefits`;
- `supervises`;
- `delegates_to`; and
- `recognized_by`.

## 13.5 Key Binding Record

A Key Binding Record MUST include:

- agent or deployment identifier;
- key identifier;
- key type;
- intended use;
- controller;
- validity interval;
- rotation or replacement linkage;
- status; and
- proof of control or authorized binding.

Key uses MUST be separated, including where applicable:

- registry administration;
- runtime identity;
- delegation issuance;
- receipt signing;
- payment;
- recovery;
- security suspension; and
- assurance issuance.

## 13.6 Service Endpoint Record

A Service Endpoint Record MUST include:

- endpoint identifier;
- agent or deployment identifier;
- protocol;
- URI;
- purpose;
- authentication requirements;
- region or jurisdiction, where relevant;
- data classification;
- availability status;
- effective period; and
- health or status reference.

## 13.7 Description Record

A Description Record MAY include:

- name;
- description;
- provider information;
- capabilities;
- protocols;
- supported input and output types;
- service endpoints;
- documentation references;
- policy references;
- pricing references;
- privacy notices; and
- user-facing disclosures.

A Description Record MUST NOT be treated as evidence that its claims are true.

## 13.8 Metadata Extensions

Extensions MUST use governed namespaces.

An extension MUST declare:

- namespace;
- schema identifier;
- schema version;
- criticality;
- validation rules; and
- processing semantics.

A relying party MUST reject a record containing an unknown critical extension.

---

# 14. Registry and Enforcement Interaction

## 14.1 Separation of Resolution, Decision, and Enforcement

The registry resolves authoritative records and status. The Policy Decision Point evaluates them against context and policy. The Policy Enforcement Point applies the decision to execution.

These functions MAY be implemented in one product, but their semantics MUST remain distinguishable. A resolver response is not automatically an authorization decision, and an authorization decision is not evidence that enforcement occurred.

## 14.2 Registration Flow

```text
Registration requester
      |
      v
Identifier and namespace validation
      |
      v
Controller and issuer authorization
      |
      v
Core, relationship, version, and deployment records
      |
      v
Governance admission and required assurance
      |
      v
Initial lifecycle state and signed event
```

A registry MUST NOT enter `active` state until the profile's required admission conditions are satisfied.

## 14.3 Delegated Action Flow

```text
Agent presents identity and runtime context
      |
      v
Resolver returns current records and freshness
      |
      v
PDP validates recognition, status, assurance, and delegation
      |
      v
PDP returns decision receipt and conditions
      |
      v
PEP validates receipt freshness and obtains approvals
      |
      v
PEP allows or denies execution
      |
      v
Runtime produces execution receipt
```

The PEP MUST validate that the decision receipt applies to the same agent, deployment, action, resource, and material context presented at execution time.

## 14.4 Revocation Flow

```text
Authorized status authority issues revocation
      |
      v
Authoritative record and event are committed
      |
      v
Caches and projections are invalidated or updated
      |
      v
Enforcement points, key managers, and subscribers are notified
      |
      v
Downstream delegation handling is applied
      |
      v
Acknowledgements and unresolved targets are recorded
```

A delegated-authority profile MUST define which enforcement targets are in scope and the maximum time within which revocation is expected to become effective.

## 14.5 Appeal and Restoration Flow

```text
Affected party files correction or appeal
      |
      v
Appeal record and applicable interim state are published
      |
      v
Authorized authority reviews evidence
      |
      v
Decision confirms, modifies, or reverses prior action
      |
      v
Restoration or correction event is published
      |
      v
Subscribers and enforcement points update state
```

Restoration MUST NOT erase the historical suspension, revocation, or investigation. It creates a new effective state and preserves the basis for both decisions.

## 14.6 Enforcement Acknowledgement

Where required by profile, an enforcement point MUST emit an acknowledgement identifying:

- the status or authority event applied;
- the affected enforcement surface;
- the time applied;
- any partial failure;
- retry or remediation status; and
- proof or authenticated source.

---

# 15. Agent Registration

## 15.1 Registration Request

A registration request MUST identify the requested namespace, proposed controller, agent class, initial description, governance domain, and proof that the requester is authorized under the applicable registration policy.

## 15.2 Admission Processing

The Registration Authority MUST validate uniqueness, namespace policy, controller authorization, required relationship records, prohibited impersonation, and any profile-specific evidence. It MUST record the policy version used for admission.

## 15.3 Initial State

A newly created identifier SHOULD enter `provisioned` or `pending_assurance`. It MUST NOT enter `active` until all mandatory profile and governance conditions are satisfied.

## 15.4 Registration Evidence

The registration event MUST contain or resolve to the request digest, issuer, controller, governing policy, effective time, initial state, and proof.

## 15.5 Duplicate and Deceptive Registration

Registries MUST define procedures for detecting and resolving duplicate, confusing, or deceptive identifiers and names. Human-readable names MUST NOT be assumed unique.

---

# 16. Version and Deployment Management

## 16.1 Version Record

A Version Record MUST identify the logical agent, version identifier, predecessor, artifact digest, release time, declared capability set, policy bundle, material dependencies, and material-change classification.

## 16.2 Deployment Record

Profiles B through D MUST represent each consequential deployment separately. A Deployment Record MUST identify the agent version, deployer, operator, environment or profile, runtime identity method, service endpoints, jurisdiction, status references, and creation time.

## 16.3 Version-to-Deployment Binding

An operational deployment MUST reference exactly one current agent version at a time. A version transition MUST produce an event and update affected assurance and authority applicability.

## 16.4 Runtime Substitution

A deployment MUST NOT claim the assurance or authority of a registered version if the executing artifact, model configuration, policy bundle, or critical tool set materially differs from the bound version.

## 16.5 Rollback

A rollback to an earlier version MUST be treated as a new deployment transition. The registry MUST reevaluate assurance validity, known vulnerabilities, authority applicability, and policy compatibility.

---

# 17. Relationship Management

## 17.1 Typed Relationships

Relationships MUST be represented as first-class records with issuer, scope, validity, status, and governance basis. A free-text description of a relationship is insufficient for normative processing.

## 17.2 Relationship Authority

The registry MUST define which role may create, modify, or terminate each relationship type. An operator MUST NOT appoint a new accountable entity unless explicitly authorized to do so.

## 17.3 Multiple Relationships

An agent MAY have multiple operators, controllers, principals, beneficiaries, or accountable entities. Each record MUST define scope so that a relying party can determine which relationship applies to the requested action or deployment.

## 17.4 Change and Termination

A relationship change MUST produce an event and trigger impact analysis for linked delegations, assurance claims, deployments, evidence access, and governance recognition.

---

# 18. Delegation and Authority

> **Candidate controls:** ARPA-CAND-001, ARPA-CAND-002, ARPA-CAND-006. Delegation evaluation MUST compute the intersection of all applicable scopes, conditions, prohibitions, validity intervals, and lifecycle states. Circular, expired, suspended, revoked, or unverifiable links MUST NOT yield affirmative authority.

## 18.1 General Requirement

An agent registry supporting consequential action MUST support machine-readable delegation records.

## 18.2 Authority Envelope

An Authority Envelope MUST include:

- authority identifier;
- principal;
- agent;
- issuer;
- action classes;
- resource scope;
- purpose scope;
- jurisdictional scope;
- valid-from and valid-until;
- financial or quantitative limits, where applicable;
- prohibitions;
- required approvals;
- delegation mode;
- downstream delegation limits;
- evidence requirements;
- revocation mechanism;
- status endpoint;
- governance framework;
- redress profile; and
- proof.

## 18.3 Delegation Modes

Supported modes MUST include:

- `non_delegable`;
- `delegable_once`;
- `delegable_within_scope`;
- `delegable_with_explicit_approval`;
- `delegable_to_named_agents`; and
- `delegable_under_governance_profile`.

## 18.4 Delegation Narrowing

A downstream delegation MUST NOT exceed the upstream authority from which it derives.

A conforming authority evaluator MUST verify:

- action subset;
- resource subset;
- purpose subset;
- time subset;
- jurisdiction subset;
- quantitative limits;
- prohibition inheritance;
- approval inheritance;
- assurance requirements;
- delegation depth; and
- revocation status.

## 18.5 Authority Evaluation

An authority evaluation request SHOULD include:

- agent;
- principal;
- action;
- resource;
- purpose;
- amount or quantity;
- jurisdiction;
- current time;
- deployment;
- requested delegation depth;
- assurance context; and
- relying-party policy.

The result MUST be one of:

- `allow`;
- `allow_with_conditions`;
- `deny`;
- `indeterminate`; or
- `not_applicable`.

An `allow_with_conditions` result MUST enumerate all required conditions.

## 18.6 Decision Receipt

Every authority evaluation in accountable or higher profiles MUST produce a Decision Receipt containing:

- request digest;
- decision;
- evaluated authority records;
- evaluated status records;
- evaluated policy version;
- conditions;
- evaluation time;
- validity duration;
- evaluator identity;
- freshness metadata;
- proof; and
- reason codes.

## 18.7 Revocation

Authority revocation MUST specify:

- revoked authority;
- effective time;
- issuer;
- reason;
- scope;
- downstream propagation behavior;
- historical effect;
- enforcement targets;
- required acknowledgements; and
- appeal route.

## 18.8 Cascade Revocation

Where an authority has been delegated further, the system MUST define whether revocation:

- cascades automatically;
- causes downstream suspension pending evaluation;
- affects only new actions;
- affects uncompleted actions;
- affects prior receipts; or
- requires compensating action.

## 18.9 Runtime Enforcement

Delegated authority profiles MUST define integration with policy enforcement points.

A registry MUST NOT claim effective revocation unless it can demonstrate either:

- acknowledgement from relevant enforcement points; or
- a clearly disclosed maximum revocation propagation time.

---

# 19. Capability and Assurance

## 19.1 Capability Types

The registry MUST distinguish:

1. capability declaration;
2. capability verification;
3. capability authorization;
4. capability invocation;
5. capability outcome.

## 19.2 Capability Declaration

A declaration SHOULD include:

- capability identifier;
- vocabulary or taxonomy;
- version;
- input types;
- output types;
- preconditions;
- side effects;
- risk classification;
- required permissions;
- supported protocols; and
- claimed limitations.

## 19.3 Capability Verification

A verification record MUST include:

- tested subject;
- tested version;
- tested deployment profile;
- test method;
- test environment;
- evaluator;
- result;
- limitations;
- evidence reference;
- validity period; and
- proof.

## 19.4 Capability Authorization

Capability authorization MUST be represented through authority or policy records, not solely through the description record.

## 19.5 Risk Classification

Registries SHOULD classify capabilities by risk, such as:

- informational;
- advisory;
- data-accessing;
- workflow-modifying;
- transaction-preparing;
- transaction-submitting;
- asset-controlling;
- identity-affecting;
- rights-affecting;
- safety-critical; and
- irreversible.

Higher-risk classes SHOULD trigger stronger conformance requirements.

## 19.6 Capability Drift

A material change to capabilities MUST trigger:

- a new agent version;
- assurance review;
- policy reevaluation;
- updated disclosure;
- updated authorization analysis; and
- relying-party notification where required.

---

## 19.7 Assurance Object

An Assurance Claim MUST include:

- assurance identifier;
- subject;
- subject version;
- artifact digest;
- deployment scope;
- assurance profile;
- evaluated controls;
- evidence references;
- assessor;
- issue time;
- validity period;
- status;
- limitations;
- excluded capabilities;
- re-evaluation triggers; and
- proof.

## 19.8 Assurance Profiles

A registry MAY support multiple assurance profiles.

Each profile MUST define:

- target risk class;
- required controls;
- evaluation method;
- evidence requirements;
- assessor qualification;
- validity duration;
- monitoring requirements;
- incident obligations;
- suspension rules; and
- renewal rules.

## 19.9 Binding Requirements

An assurance claim MUST be bound to all material elements that were evaluated, including as applicable:

- software artifact;
- model identifier or family;
- model configuration;
- policy bundle;
- tools;
- execution environment;
- deployment profile;
- data-processing region;
- key set;
- monitoring configuration; and
- version.

## 19.10 Material Change

A profile MUST define material change.

Examples SHOULD include:

- new model family;
- material model update;
- new high-risk capability;
- change of operator;
- change of accountable entity;
- new external tool;
- new data jurisdiction;
- security-control reduction;
- policy-bundle replacement;
- key compromise; or
- architecture change affecting isolation or authorization.

## 19.11 Assurance Status

Supported assurance states MUST include:

- `valid`;
- `conditional`;
- `expired`;
- `suspended`;
- `revoked`;
- `superseded`; and
- `indeterminate`.

## 19.12 No Universal Trust Flag

A registry MUST NOT reduce assurance to a universal boolean “trusted” field.

---

# 20. Lifecycle and Status

> **Candidate controls:** ARPA-CAND-005 and ARPA-CAND-006. Lifecycle state is time-dependent. Implementations MUST preserve effective timestamps and MUST distinguish registry publication of a state change from enforcement convergence.

## 20.1 Registration States

A conforming registry MUST support at least:

- `provisioned`;
- `pending_assurance`;
- `active`;
- `restricted`;
- `suspended`;
- `quarantined`;
- `compromised`;
- `revoked`;
- `retired`;
- `superseded`; and
- `under_investigation`.

## 20.2 State Semantics

### provisioned

An identifier exists, but the agent is not yet eligible for ordinary reliance.

### pending_assurance

Required evaluation or approval is incomplete.

### active

The agent is eligible for interaction subject to authority, assurance, and local policy.

### restricted

The agent may operate only within specified reduced scope.

### suspended

New activity is prohibited or limited pending review, repair, or restoration.

### quarantined

The agent or deployment is isolated due to elevated security or integrity concerns.

### compromised

A material compromise has been confirmed or is treated as confirmed.

### revoked

The registry has terminated recognition or eligibility under the relevant governance framework.

### retired

The agent has ceased operation through an orderly process.

### superseded

A successor agent or version has replaced the current subject.

### under_investigation

A formal review is active. This status alone MUST NOT imply guilt or compromise.

## 20.3 Transition Requirements

Every material lifecycle transition MUST record:

- prior state;
- new state;
- effective time;
- issuing authority;
- reason code;
- governance basis;
- affected scope;
- whether historical actions are affected;
- whether appeal is available;
- whether downstream notifications were emitted; and
- whether enforcement acknowledgement is required.

## 20.4 Transfer and Change of Control

A change in controller, operator, accountable entity, or ownership-like relationship MUST NOT automatically transfer:

- delegations;
- assurance claims;
- runtime credentials;
- payment bindings;
- confidential evidence access;
- downstream authority;
- sponsor endorsements; or
- governance recognition.

Each affected record MUST define whether it:

- terminates;
- remains valid;
- requires novation;
- requires reissuance;
- enters review; or
- becomes restricted.

## 20.5 Retirement

Retirement MUST preserve:

- historical identifier resolution;
- status history;
- lineage;
- prior assurance references;
- prior delegation references, subject to privacy;
- execution evidence references; and
- redress routes.

## 20.6 Supersession

A superseded agent MUST resolve to:

- its historical record;
- the successor reference;
- the effective supersession time;
- the migration policy;
- authority transition rules; and
- whether previous delegation remains valid.

---

## 20.7 Multi-Dimensional Status

A status response MUST distinguish at minimum:

- registration status;
- operational status;
- authority status;
- assurance status;
- security status.

## 20.8 Operational States

Supported operational states SHOULD include:

- `available`;
- `degraded`;
- `restricted`;
- `maintenance`;
- `offline`;
- `draining`;
- `quarantined`; and
- `unknown`.

## 20.9 Security States

Supported security states SHOULD include:

High-assurance profiles MUST support evidence that the currently executing workload corresponds to the registered deployment or an approved equivalent.

## 20.11 Freshness

Operational and security status responses MUST include:

- observed_at;
- issued_at;
- valid_until or maximum age;
- source;
- confidence or authority level; and
- evidence reference.

## 20.12 Emergency Suspension

A conforming registry SHOULD support a rapid emergency suspension process distinct from final revocation.

Emergency suspension SHOULD:

- take effect quickly;
- support narrow scope;
- preserve due process;
- require post-action review;
- support restoration;
- produce signed events; and
- notify enforcement points.

---

# 21. Query Protocol

## 21.1 Transport

The specification is transport-independent.

Implementations MUST provide at least one machine-readable query interface over a secure transport.

HTTP-based deployments SHOULD use:

- HTTPS;
- JSON request and response bodies;
- authenticated access where required;
- stable media types; and
- idempotent semantics for read operations.

## 21.2 Media Type

This specification reserves the provisional media type:

```text
application/agent-registry+json
```

## 21.3 Core Endpoints

A conforming HTTP implementation SHOULD provide:

```text
GET  /agents/{agent_id}
GET  /agents/{agent_id}/status
GET  /agents/{agent_id}/lineage
GET  /agents/{agent_id}/relationships
GET  /agents/{agent_id}/capabilities
GET  /agents/{agent_id}/assurance
GET  /agents/{agent_id}/governance
GET  /agents/{agent_id}/events
POST /authority/evaluate
POST /reliance/evaluate
POST /discovery/search
GET  /records/{record_id}
GET  /events
```

## 21.4 Point-in-Time Queries

All core state queries MUST support a point-in-time parameter.

Example:

```text
GET /agents/{agent_id}?at=2026-07-15T10:00:00Z
```

A point-in-time response MUST disclose whether it is:

- authoritative;
- reconstructed;
- incomplete;
- approximate; or
- indeterminate.

## 21.5 Query Response Envelope

Every response MUST include:

```json
{
  "request_id": "string",
  "result": {},
  "result_status": "success",
  "authoritative": true,
  "source": {
    "registry": "string",
    "checkpoint": "string",
    "source_time": "date-time"
  },
  "projection": {
    "used": false,
    "updated_at": null,
    "lag_seconds": 0
  },
  "generated_at": "date-time",
  "valid_until": "date-time",
  "warnings": []
}
```

## 21.6 Reliability Metadata

A response used for consequential reliance MUST include:

- source identifier;
- source checkpoint;
- source timestamp;
- projection status;
- known lag;
- response timestamp;
- validity window;
- status freshness;
- proof or verification reference; and
- policy version where a decision is returned.

## 21.7 Discovery Search

Discovery MUST support structured filters.

Supported filter classes SHOULD include:

- capability;
- assurance profile;
- governance framework;
- jurisdiction;
- protocol;
- risk class;
- operational status;
- security status;
- accountable entity;
- operator;
- data-handling constraints;
- cost class;
- latency or service-level attributes; and
- recognition domain.

Search results MUST NOT imply authorization or suitability.

## 21.8 Reliance Evaluation

A reliance request SHOULD include:

- candidate agent;
- intended action;
- required assurance profile;
- accepted governance authorities;
- accepted assurance providers;
- maximum status age;
- accepted jurisdictions;
- runtime attestation requirements;
- incident policy;
- delegation requirements;
- privacy requirements; and
- local relying-party policy identifier.

The result MUST include:

- `satisfied`;
- `not_satisfied`;
- `indeterminate`;
- unmet conditions;
- supporting evidence;
- warnings;
- freshness;
- policy version; and
- decision receipt.

## 21.9 Query Authorization

Registries MUST support access-control policy for protected records.

A denied response SHOULD disclose only what policy permits.

## 21.10 Cache Control

Responses MUST specify cacheability and maximum age.

High-risk authority or security queries SHOULD be non-cacheable or short-lived unless protected by signed status objects.

---

# 22. Authority Evaluation

Authority evaluation determines whether a particular action is within a valid delegation and applicable policy. Implementations MUST expose the request, response, and Decision Receipt semantics defined in Sections 18, 21, 25, and 28.

## 22.1 Inputs

The evaluator MUST accept sufficient context to identify the agent, principal, action, resource, purpose, time, deployment, jurisdiction, quantitative values, approval state, and relying policy.

## 22.2 Output

The decision MUST be `allow`, `allow_with_conditions`, `deny`, `indeterminate`, or `not_applicable`. Conditions and reason codes MUST be explicit.

## 22.3 Processing

The evaluator MUST follow Section 28.2. A deployment MUST NOT claim interoperable authority evaluation if it omits delegation-lineage validation, status freshness, or issuer-competence checks required by its profile.

---

# 23. Reliance Evaluation

Reliance evaluation determines whether an agent satisfies a relying party's contextual requirements. It is distinct from authority evaluation: an agent may satisfy assurance and governance requirements but lack authority for a particular action, or hold authority while failing the relying party's security or assurance policy.

## 23.1 Request

A request SHOULD identify the intended action, required assurance, accepted governance authorities and assurance providers, maximum status age, jurisdiction, runtime-attestation requirement, incident policy, privacy constraints, and local policy identifier.

## 23.2 Response

The response MUST be `satisfied`, `not_satisfied`, or `indeterminate` and MUST enumerate supporting evidence, unmet conditions, warnings, freshness, and the evaluated policy version.

## 23.3 Processing

The evaluator MUST follow Section 28.3 and produce a Decision Receipt when required by profile.

---

# 24. Events and Subscriptions

> **Candidate control:** ARPA-CAND-007. Candidate-conformant event delivery requires durable sequencing, replay, deduplication, idempotent processing, checkpointing, gap detection, retry, and evidence of consumer acknowledgement.

## 24.1 Event Requirements

## 24.2 Event Types

Base event types SHOULD include:

- `agent.registered`;
- `agent.activated`;
- `agent.updated`;

- `agent.suspended`;
- `agent.quarantined`;
- `agent.compromised`;
- `agent.revoked`;

- `incident.opened`;
- `incident.updated`;
- `incident.closed`;
- `appeal.filed`;
- `appeal.decided`;
- `status.restored`;
- `recognition.added`;
- `recognition.changed`; and
- `recognition.withdrawn`.

## 24.3 Event Envelope

```json
{
  "event_id": "string",
  "event_type": "agent.suspended",
  "subject": "agentreg:example.org:agent-123",
  "sequence": 1021,
  "occurred_at": "2026-07-15T10:00:00Z",
  "effective_at": "2026-07-15T10:00:00Z",
  "issuer": "registry:example.org",
  "reason_code": "security_review",
  "scope": {},
  "record_refs": [],
  "proof": {}
}
```

## 24.4 Ordering

Events MUST include a per-subject or per-registry ordering mechanism.

## 24.5 Replay

Subscribers MUST be able to request replay from a checkpoint, event identifier, or timestamp.

## 24.6 Delivery Semantics

A registry MUST declare whether event delivery is:

- at-most-once;
- at-least-once; or
- effectively-once.

Consumers MUST be able to deduplicate events using `event_id`.

## 24.7 Enforcement Acknowledgement

High-assurance profiles SHOULD support acknowledgement events from enforcement points.

---

# 25. Execution and Decision Receipts

## 25.1 Applicability

Execution evidence is REQUIRED for accountable, delegated-authority, and high-assurance profiles for actions classified as consequential.

## 25.2 Execution Receipt Contents

An Execution Receipt MUST include, as applicable:

- receipt identifier;
- task or transaction identifier;
- agent identifier;
- agent version;
- deployment identifier;
- runtime identifier;
- principal;
- beneficiary;
- authority envelope identifier;
- authority decision receipt;
- policy version;
- action class;
- resource;
- purpose;
- input digest;
- output digest;
- tool and service references;
- approvals obtained;
- downstream delegations;
- start time;
- completion time;
- result;
- side effects;
- error or exception;
- evidence references;
- redress reference; and
- proof.

## 25.3 Confidentiality

Receipts MAY omit confidential payloads while retaining digests, references, or selectively disclosable evidence.

## 25.4 Non-Repudiation and Attribution

A receipt SHOULD support verification that:

- the relevant runtime produced or endorsed it;
- the authority decision existed before or during execution;
- required approvals were obtained;
- the referenced policy version was active; and
- the receipt has not been altered.

## 25.5 Failure Receipts

Failed and denied actions SHOULD produce receipts when they are relevant to audit, abuse detection, or dispute resolution.

## 25.6 Retention

Governance profiles MUST define retention periods for receipts and supporting evidence.

---

# 26. Federation and Recognition

> **Candidate controls:** ARPA-CAND-003 and ARPA-CAND-004. Recognition is an explicit, scoped, time-bound governance statement. Federation is a technical exchange relationship and MUST NOT be interpreted as recognition, transitive trust, or transfer of authority.

## 26.1 Federation Principle

Registries MAY interoperate technically without mutually recognizing each other’s records.

Recognition MUST be explicit.

## 26.2 Recognition Record

A Recognition Record MUST specify:

- recognizing domain;
- recognized domain or issuer;
- recognized record types;
- recognized assurance profiles;
- recognized governance decisions;
- status handling;
- effective period;
- exclusions;
- transformation rules;
- dispute rules;
- withdrawal semantics; and
- proof.

## 26.3 Partial Recognition

Recognition MAY be partial.

Examples:

- identity records accepted, assurance claims rejected;
- assurance claims accepted only for low-risk actions;
- suspensions recognized immediately, restorations subject to review;
- one jurisdiction’s governance decisions accepted only for specified agents.

## 26.4 Recognition Chains

A registry MUST NOT automatically infer transitive recognition unless explicitly authorized.

## 26.5 Conflicting Status

Where recognized sources conflict, the relying policy MUST define precedence, aggregation, or indeterminate handling.

## 26.6 Federation Discovery

A federation SHOULD publish:

- participating registries;
- namespaces;
- supported profiles;
- recognition rules;
- schema versions;
- trust anchors;
- query endpoints; and
- incident contacts.

---

# 27. Governance, Appeals, and Redress

## 27.1 Governance Metadata

A conforming registry MUST publish or resolve:

- governance authority;
- governance framework identifier;
- policy version;
- admission criteria;
- monitoring obligations;
- suspension and revocation rules;
- appeal procedure;
- dispute venue;
- incident reporting endpoint;
- recognition policy;
- transparency policy;
- emergency process;
- restoration process;
- data retention rules; and
- redress process.

## 27.2 Reason Codes

Lifecycle and enforcement actions MUST use structured reason codes.

Free-text explanation MAY supplement but MUST NOT replace structured reason codes.

## 27.3 Appeal

A registry MUST support appeal or correction processes for:

- incorrect identity binding;
- unauthorized control change;
- erroneous suspension;
- erroneous revocation;
- inaccurate relationship record;
- incorrect assurance status;
- misattributed execution;
- stale status;
- unlawful or invalid delegation; and
- disputed recognition decision.

## 27.4 Due Process

Governance profiles SHOULD specify:

- notice;
- opportunity to respond;
- emergency exception;
- evidence standards;
- decision authority;
- time limits;
- publication rules;
- restoration;
- correction;
- compensation or remediation where applicable.

## 27.5 Redress Record

A Redress Record SHOULD include:

- affected subject;
- complainant class;
- issue type;
- intake endpoint;
- required evidence;
- response time;
- escalation path;
- appeal path;
- available remedies;
- responsible entity; and
- governing policy.

## 27.6 Essential Service Continuity

High-assurance public-service profiles SHOULD define fallback or continuity arrangements when suspension of an agent could deny access to essential services.

---

# 28. Processing Rules

This section defines the normative processing behavior that connects the record model to interoperable decisions.

## 28.1 General Evaluation Rules

An evaluator MUST:

1. validate record syntax and schema;
2. validate proof integrity where required;
3. validate issuer competence and recognition;
4. validate time applicability;
5. validate status and freshness;
6. resolve supersession and lineage;
7. apply profile and relying-party policy;
8. preserve warnings and conflicting evidence; and
9. produce a deterministic outcome for the same inputs, records, and policy version.

An evaluator MUST NOT silently ignore an unknown critical extension, invalid proof, unresolved required status, or unrecognized issuer.

## 28.2 Authority Evaluation Algorithm

A conforming authority evaluator MUST perform the following steps or an equivalent process preserving the same semantics:

1. Resolve the agent identifier.
2. Resolve the relevant agent version and deployment.
3. Confirm that registration status permits the requested class of action.
4. Confirm that operational and security status permit execution.
5. Confirm that all required status records satisfy freshness policy.
6. Resolve the immediate authority envelope for the agent and principal.
7. Resolve the complete delegation lineage required by the envelope.
8. Verify proofs, issuer competence, validity periods, and revocation status for every delegation.
9. Verify that each downstream delegation narrows or preserves, but never expands, upstream action, resource, purpose, jurisdiction, time, quantitative limit, approval, prohibition, assurance, and delegation-depth constraints.
10. Evaluate the requested action, resource, purpose, jurisdiction, amount, time, deployment, and other contextual inputs.
11. Apply mandatory prohibitions before discretionary conditions.
12. Determine required approvals and whether they are already satisfied.
13. Resolve required assurance claims and confirm applicability to the current version and deployment.
14. Evaluate registry, issuer, assurance-provider, and governance recognition.
15. Apply the named relying-party policy.
16. Return `allow`, `allow_with_conditions`, `deny`, `indeterminate`, or `not_applicable`.
17. Produce a Decision Receipt.

A failed mandatory prohibition check MUST result in `deny`. Missing required current status or conflicting authoritative evidence SHOULD result in `indeterminate` unless policy explicitly requires denial.

## 28.3 Reliance Evaluation Algorithm

A reliance evaluator MUST determine whether the candidate agent satisfies the relying party's conditions independently of whether a particular delegation exists. It MUST evaluate, as applicable:

- registry recognition;
- identifier continuity;
- current version and deployment;
- accountable entity;
- required assurance profile;
- assurance-provider recognition;
- material-change status;
- runtime attestation;
- operational and security status;
- open incidents;
- jurisdiction and data-handling constraints;
- governance framework;
- redress availability;
- evidence availability; and
- freshness policy.

The result MUST enumerate unmet or indeterminate conditions. It MUST NOT return a generic `trusted` boolean.

## 28.4 Status Precedence

Status dimensions MUST remain separately visible. For execution gating, the following default precedence SHOULD apply unless a profile defines a stricter rule:

```text
confirmed_compromise
    > quarantined
    > revoked
    > suspended
    > restricted
    > active
```

An `under_investigation` state does not by itself imply compromise. The governing profile MUST define whether it triggers monitoring, restriction, suspension, or no automatic execution effect.

When dimensions conflict, the most restrictive applicable status MUST govern execution. The response MUST preserve all source statuses and explain the precedence rule used.

## 28.5 Point-in-Time Reconstruction

A point-in-time query MUST evaluate records according to their effective intervals and the authoritative events known for the requested time.

The response MUST state whether reconstruction is:

- `authoritative_complete`;
- `authoritative_partial`;
- `reconstructed_complete`;
- `reconstructed_partial`;
- `approximate`; or
- `indeterminate`.

A registry MUST NOT substitute current state for historical state without an explicit warning. Missing historical evidence MUST be surfaced rather than inferred as valid.

## 28.6 Material Change Processing

When a material change occurs, the registry MUST determine which linked records are affected. The result for each assurance claim, delegation, relationship, endpoint, and deployment MUST be one of:

- remains valid;
- remains valid with narrowed scope;
- enters review;
- becomes conditional;
- becomes suspended;
- terminates;
- requires reissuance; or
- requires novation.

The change event MUST identify the applicable transition policy.

## 28.7 Revocation and Cascade Processing

On revocation, the processor MUST:

1. validate revocation authority;
2. identify effective time and scope;
3. update authoritative status;
4. identify directly dependent delegations and enforcement surfaces;
5. apply the governing cascade rule;
6. emit events;
7. invalidate applicable cached decisions;
8. notify enforcement points;
9. record acknowledgements and failures; and
10. preserve the prior record for historical resolution.

A downstream delegation MUST NOT remain affirmatively active when its required parent authority is revoked. It MUST become revoked, suspended, or indeterminate according to declared cascade semantics.

## 28.8 Conflict Processing

When recognized sources conflict, the evaluator MUST apply a published precedence or aggregation policy. If no applicable rule resolves the conflict, the result MUST be `indeterminate`.

The evaluator MUST include:

- conflicting claims;
- issuers;
- effective times;
- recognition basis;
- precedence rule attempted; and
- required remediation or authoritative query.

## 28.9 Decision Validity and Reuse

A Decision Receipt MUST have a bounded validity period. A PEP MUST reject reuse when any material input differs, including agent, deployment, action, resource, amount, purpose, approval state, or relevant status checkpoint.

A status or revocation event affecting the decision MAY invalidate the receipt before its scheduled expiry. Profiles MUST define how invalidation is communicated.

## 28.10 Negative Outcome Examples

### Expired Assurance

```json
{
  "decision": "indeterminate",
  "reason_codes": ["assurance_expired"],
  "required_actions": ["obtain_current_assurance"]
}
```

### Revoked Upstream Delegation

```json
{
  "decision": "deny",
  "reason_codes": [
    "upstream_authority_revoked",
    "downstream_delegation_invalid"
  ]
}
```

### Stale Projection

```json
{
  "decision": "indeterminate",
  "reason_codes": ["projection_lag_exceeds_policy"],
  "authoritative_query_required": true
}
```

### Conflicting Recognized Status

```json
{
  "decision": "indeterminate",
  "reason_codes": ["recognized_sources_conflict"],
  "conflicts": [
    {"source": "registry-a", "status": "active"},
    {"source": "registry-b", "status": "suspended"}
  ]
}
```

# 29. Security Architecture

> **Candidate control:** ARPA-CAND-008. Cryptographic proof establishes only the claims supported by the proof and trust configuration. It MUST NOT, by itself, establish current authority, assurance, governance recognition, or acceptable reliance.

## 29.1 Threat Model

Implementations MUST consider at least:

- false registration;
- identifier takeover;
- key compromise;
- controller compromise;
- malicious operator;
- compromised registry operator;
- stale index or cache;
- equivocation;
- unauthorized metadata change;
- capability inflation;
- assurance laundering;
- delegation escalation;
- revocation failure;
- downstream delegation persistence;
- replay;
- forged receipts;
- endpoint substitution;
- malicious schema extension;
- denial of service;
- privacy leakage;
- correlation;
- insider abuse;
- compromised policy decision point;
- compromised policy enforcement point;
- malicious federation peer;
- conflicting recognition; and
- governance capture.

## 29.2 Key Separation

High-impact administrative functions MUST use separated keys or authorization roles.

At minimum, high-assurance profiles SHOULD separate:

- control;
- operations;
- delegation;
- assurance;
- payment;
- security suspension;
- recovery; and
- governance enforcement.

## 29.3 Threshold Authorization

The following operations SHOULD require threshold approval in high-assurance profiles:

- change of accountable entity;
- ownership-like transfer;
- security restoration after compromise;
- replacement of recovery keys;
- modification of governance framework;
- broad authority issuance;
- removal of critical prohibitions; and
- deletion or redaction of evidence.

## 29.4 Transaction Intent

Administrative interfaces MUST present human- or machine-verifiable transaction intent before authorization.

Intent SHOULD disclose:

- action;
- subject;
- affected records;
- effective time;
- downstream effects;
- irreversible effects;
- required approvals; and
- policy basis.

## 29.5 Revocation Propagation

A conformance profile MUST define maximum acceptable propagation time from authoritative revocation to enforcement.

## 29.6 Stale Data

A relying party MUST be able to enforce maximum age for:

- agent status;
- authority status;
- assurance status;
- runtime attestation;
- incident status; and
- recognition rules.

## 29.7 Endpoint Security

Registries MUST:

- use authenticated transport;
- validate endpoint schemes;
- prevent server-side request forgery in registry fetchers;
- constrain redirects;
- validate content type;
- limit payload size;
- isolate parsing;
- validate schemas; and
- preserve historical versions of critical descriptions.

## 29.8 Schema Security

Unknown critical extensions MUST cause processing failure.

Registries SHOULD maintain:

- extension registries;
- namespace ownership;
- schema signing;
- size limits;
- recursion limits;
- prohibited fields; and
- deprecation rules.

## 29.9 Equivocation

A registry MUST prevent or detect the presentation of conflicting authoritative state to different relying parties.

Suitable mechanisms MAY include:

- transparency logs;
- signed checkpoints;
- append-only journals;
- witness cosigning;
- distributed consensus;
- audit replication; or
- cross-operator reconciliation.

## 29.10 Recovery

Recovery procedures MUST be documented and auditable.

A recovery event MUST NOT silently erase compromise history.

## 29.11 Dependency Security

Assurance and operational profiles SHOULD disclose material dependencies, including:

- model providers;
- tool providers;
- hosting environments;
- identity providers;
- key management systems;
- policy engines; and
- external registries.

## 29.12 Denial of Service

Registries SHOULD support:

- rate limits;
- query cost controls;
- pagination;
- bounded search;
- event backpressure;
- replicated read paths;
- degraded-mode status;
- abuse detection; and
- emergency read-only operation.

---

# 30. Privacy Architecture

## 30.1 Privacy Objective

The registry MUST support reliable decisions without requiring universal publication of identity, relationship, delegation, telemetry, or evidence data. Privacy is therefore an architectural property of resolution, access, and disclosure, not merely a notice or retention policy.

## 30.2 Public Pointer, Protected Record

A public record MAY reveal only:

- record identifier;
- record type;
- issuer;
- subject commitment or scoped identifier;
- current status;
- digest;
- access endpoint;
- disclosure policy; and
- proof.

The full record MAY remain protected. The resolver MUST distinguish “record exists but access is restricted” from “record not found” where policy permits.

## 30.3 Selective Attribute Disclosure

A registry SHOULD support proofs or attestations of policy-relevant properties without disclosing the complete source record. Examples include:

- authority covers the requested action;
- spending limit is at least the requested amount;
- assurance profile meets a named minimum;
- deployment is within an accepted jurisdiction;
- required human approval was obtained; or
- no disqualifying incident is currently active.

## 30.4 Pairwise and Scoped Identifiers

Where correlation risk is material, a registry SHOULD support pairwise or context-scoped agent, principal, or relationship identifiers. A protected linkage MAY connect scoped identifiers to a canonical record for authorized audit or redress.

## 30.5 Confidential Authority Envelopes

An authority envelope MAY contain commercially sensitive or personal terms. A conforming implementation MAY provide a derived authorization proof or decision receipt rather than disclose the complete envelope, provided that the relying party can verify:

- the relevant issuer;
- the requested action and context were evaluated;
- required constraints were applied;
- the authority was current; and
- the decision can be audited by an authorized party.

## 30.6 Confidential Execution Evidence

Execution receipts SHOULD avoid embedding raw protected inputs or outputs. They SHOULD use digests, encrypted references, scoped evidence packages, and access-control policies appropriate to the action.

## 30.7 Query Privacy

Registries MUST consider that search and status queries can reveal intent, relationships, or investigations. Higher profiles SHOULD support authenticated queries, query minimization, private status checking, rate controls, and auditable access.

## 30.8 Correlation and Graph Reconstruction

Persistent public relationship graphs can reveal organizational structure, beneficiaries, suppliers, or personal associations. Deployments SHOULD assess whether each relationship must be public, ecosystem-visible, pairwise, or confidential.

## 30.9 Data Subject and Affected-Party Rights

Governance profiles SHOULD define rights to access, correction, annotation, restriction, and appeal. Correction MUST preserve necessary audit history without continuing to present incorrect data as current.

## 30.10 Privacy Pattern Declaration

A conforming deployment SHOULD publish which privacy patterns it supports:

- public record;
- public pointer and protected record;
- selective attribute disclosure;
- pairwise identifier;
- confidential authority envelope;
- confidential evidence package;
- privacy-preserving status; and
- protected point-in-time reconstruction.

---

# 31. Scalability and Availability

## 31.1 Federated Architecture

A scalable deployment SHOULD use federated registries with globally resolvable identifiers and locally governed participation.

## 31.2 Tiered Storage

Implementations SHOULD use storage appropriate to data type:

| Layer | Recommended Data |
| --- | --- |
| Immutable log or transparency layer | Critical identifiers, hashes, status transitions, governance checkpoints |
| Authoritative registry database | Current structured records and relationships |
| Content-addressed storage | Descriptions, schemas, policy bundles, evidence manifests |
| Operational telemetry store | Health, attestation, monitoring data |
| Confidential evidence store | Detailed audit and execution evidence |
| Search index | Discovery and taxonomy-based search |

## 31.3 Read Scalability

Read traffic MAY be served through replicated projections if freshness and provenance requirements are met.

## 31.4 Write Serialization

Implementations MUST define conflict resolution and serialization rules for concurrent updates.

## 31.5 Partition Behavior

A deployment MUST document behavior during network partition, including:

- whether reads continue;
- whether writes continue;
- whether authority decisions fail closed or fail open;
- which statuses are considered safe;
- how reconciliation occurs; and
- how conflicting events are handled.

High-assurance profiles SHOULD fail closed for stale or unavailable authority status.

## 31.6 Pagination

List and search endpoints MUST use bounded pagination.

## 31.7 Bulk Status

Registries SHOULD support bulk status resolution for large relying systems.

## 31.8 Event Scalability

Event systems SHOULD support:

- partitioned topics;
- resumable cursors;
- filtering;
- compaction;
- replay;
- signed checkpoints; and
- subscriber-specific authorization.

# 32. Audit and Transparency

## 32.1 Audit Log

A registry MUST maintain tamper-evident audit records for:

- registrations;
- updates;
- control changes;
- key changes;
- delegation issuance and revocation;
- assurance issuance and revocation;
- lifecycle transitions;
- governance decisions;
- recognition changes;
- administrative access;
- evidence access;
- policy changes; and
- recovery operations.

## 32.2 Transparency

Public or ecosystem-level transparency SHOULD include:

- registry policy;
- supported profiles;
- governance authority;
- operator identity;
- audit scope;
- incident statistics;
- suspension and revocation statistics;
- appeal statistics;
- recognition relationships;
- service availability;
- index lag targets;
- revocation propagation targets; and
- material policy changes.

## 32.3 Confidential Audit

Sensitive details MAY be restricted, but independent auditors SHOULD be able to verify required controls.

## 32.4 Checkpoints

A registry SHOULD publish signed checkpoints or equivalent integrity commitments.

---

# 33. Versioning and Extensibility

## 33.1 Specification Version

Every response and record MUST identify the supported specification or schema version.

The record envelope's `schema_version` (§13.1) identifies the version of the per-record-type JSON Schema under `schemas/` and follows its own semantic-versioning track, independent of this document's `Version` header (§ front matter). The two tracks are related as follows: a document major or minor version MAY be released without changing any `schema_version` (editorial or non-normative change); a `schema_version` MAY advance independently of the document version only for schema-level corrections that do not alter normative record semantics (for example, tightening a pattern already implied by prose). Any change to a record's required fields or field semantics MUST be reflected in both the document's Change Log (Appendix H) and a corresponding `schema_version` bump, and the mapping between document version and the `schema_version` values it corresponds to MUST be recorded in `schemas/README.md`. As of document version 0.5.0, the corresponding schema track is `1.0.0` (see `schemas/README.md`).

## 33.2 Backward Compatibility

Minor versions SHOULD preserve backward compatibility.

Material semantic changes MUST require a new major version.

## 33.3 Deprecation

Deprecated fields or endpoints MUST have:

- deprecation notice;
- replacement;
- migration guidance;
- sunset date; and
- compatibility behavior.

## 33.4 Extension Registry

Communities SHOULD maintain extension registries identifying:

- namespace;
- owner;
- schema;
- criticality;
- version;
- status;
- security considerations; and
- interoperability notes.

## 33.5 Unknown Fields

Unknown non-critical fields MAY be ignored but MUST be preserved where records are relayed or reserialized, unless prohibited by policy.

# 34. Error Handling

## 34.1 Error Envelope

```json
{
  "request_id": "string",
  "error": {
    "code": "ARPA-STATUS-STALE",
    "message": "The requested status exceeds the relying policy's maximum age.",
    "details": {},
    "retryable": true
  },
  "generated_at": "date-time"
}
```

## 34.2 Base Error Codes

Implementations SHOULD support:

- `ARPA-INVALID-REQUEST`;
- `ARPA-UNSUPPORTED-VERSION`;
- `ARPA-UNSUPPORTED-PROFILE`;
- `ARPA-IDENTIFIER-NOT-FOUND`;
- `ARPA-RECORD-NOT-AUTHORIZED`;
- `ARPA-SCHEMA-INVALID`;
- `ARPA-PROOF-INVALID`;
- `ARPA-ISSUER-NOT-AUTHORIZED`;
- `ARPA-STATE-TRANSITION-INVALID`;
- `ARPA-STATUS-STALE`;
- `ARPA-AUTHORITY-EXPIRED`;
- `ARPA-AUTHORITY-REVOKED`;
- `ARPA-AUTHORITY-INDETERMINATE`;
- `ARPA-DELEGATION-EXCEEDS-SCOPE`;
- `ARPA-ASSURANCE-EXPIRED`;
- `ARPA-ASSURANCE-NOT-APPLICABLE`;
- `ARPA-RUNTIME-NOT-ATTESTED`;
- `ARPA-POLICY-DENIED`;
- `ARPA-FEDERATION-NOT-RECOGNIZED`;
- `ARPA-CONFLICTING-STATUS`;
- `ARPA-PROJECTION-LAG`;
- `ARPA-RATE-LIMITED`;
- `ARPA-TEMPORARILY-UNAVAILABLE`; and
- `ARPA-INTERNAL-ERROR`.

## 34.3 HTTP Status Code Mapping

Implementations exposing an HTTP transport MUST map `ARPA-*` error codes to HTTP status codes as follows. A profile MAY use a different transport, in which case it MUST publish an equivalent mapping.

| Error code | HTTP status |
| --- | --- |
| `ARPA-INVALID-REQUEST` | 400 |
| `ARPA-UNSUPPORTED-VERSION` | 400 |
| `ARPA-UNSUPPORTED-PROFILE` | 400 |
| `ARPA-IDENTIFIER-NOT-FOUND` | 404 |
| `ARPA-RECORD-NOT-AUTHORIZED` | 403 |
| `ARPA-SCHEMA-INVALID` | 422 |
| `ARPA-PROOF-INVALID` | 422 |
| `ARPA-ISSUER-NOT-AUTHORIZED` | 403 |
| `ARPA-STATE-TRANSITION-INVALID` | 409 |
| `ARPA-STATUS-STALE` | 409 |
| `ARPA-AUTHORITY-EXPIRED` | 403 |
| `ARPA-AUTHORITY-REVOKED` | 403 |
| `ARPA-AUTHORITY-INDETERMINATE` | 409 |
| `ARPA-DELEGATION-EXCEEDS-SCOPE` | 403 |
| `ARPA-ASSURANCE-EXPIRED` | 403 |
| `ARPA-ASSURANCE-NOT-APPLICABLE` | 403 |
| `ARPA-RUNTIME-NOT-ATTESTED` | 403 |
| `ARPA-POLICY-DENIED` | 403 |
| `ARPA-FEDERATION-NOT-RECOGNIZED` | 403 |
| `ARPA-CONFLICTING-STATUS` | 409 |
| `ARPA-PROJECTION-LAG` | 409 |
| `ARPA-RATE-LIMITED` | 429 |
| `ARPA-TEMPORARILY-UNAVAILABLE` | 503 |
| `ARPA-INTERNAL-ERROR` | 500 |

A `retryable: true` error SHOULD be paired with a `Retry-After` header where the status is 429 or 503.

## 34.4 Indeterminate Results

An indeterminate result MUST explain which required inputs, records, or verifications were unavailable or conflicting.

---

# 36. Conformance Requirements

> **Candidate controls:** ARPA-CAND-009 and ARPA-CAND-010. Each implementation MUST publish a capability declaration, conformance targets, deviations, evidence references, and the exact specification and profile versions evaluated.

## 36.1 Minimum Components

A conforming deployment MUST provide:

- authoritative record store;
- resolver;
- lifecycle status service;
- governance metadata;
- proof verification;
- audit log;
- conformance declaration; and
- security and incident process.

## 36.2 Higher-Profile Components

Profiles B through D progressively require:

- relationship registry;
- assurance service;
- authority service;
- event service;
- evidence service;
- policy decision point;
- enforcement integration;
- appeal service; and
- federation service.

## 36.3 Administrative API

Administrative operations MUST be authenticated, authorized, audited, and policy-constrained.

## 36.4 Idempotency

Create and update operations SHOULD support idempotency keys.

## 36.5 Optimistic Concurrency

Updates SHOULD require an expected version, sequence, or checkpoint to prevent lost updates.

## 36.6 Validation

Registries MUST validate:

- schema;
- signatures or proofs;
- issuer authorization;
- lifecycle transition legality;
- time validity;
- namespace authorization;
- relationship type;
- delegation narrowing;
- extension criticality; and
- governance compatibility.

## 36.7 Fail-Safe Defaults

When authority, status, assurance, or governance state is indeterminate, higher-risk profiles SHOULD fail closed.

## 36.8 Observability

Registry operators MUST monitor:

- query availability;
- write availability;
- index lag;
- event lag;
- proof-verification failure;
- stale status;
- policy evaluation errors;
- revocation propagation;
- enforcement acknowledgement;
- abnormal update patterns; and
- federation failures.

---

# 37. Test Vectors and Interoperability Testing

## 37.1 Required Test Categories

A conformance suite MUST include positive and negative tests for:

- record parsing and proof validation;
- issuer competence;
- legal and illegal lifecycle transitions;
- version and deployment binding;
- delegation narrowing;
- prohibition inheritance;
- approval conditions;
- expiry and clock boundaries;
- upstream and cascade revocation;
- stale projection rejection;
- point-in-time reconstruction;
- conflicting recognized status;
- material change effects;
- event replay and deduplication;
- restoration after appeal;
- unknown critical extensions; and
- privacy-protected record resolution.

## 37.2 Interoperability Matrix

Implementors SHOULD test resolver-to-resolver, resolver-to-PDP, PDP-to-PEP, registry-to-index, registry-to-event-subscriber, and registry-to-federation-peer behavior.

## 37.3 Determinism

Given the same authenticated records, context, and policy version, conforming evaluators SHOULD produce the same decision and reason-code set. Differences caused by local policy MUST be explicitly attributable to the policy identifier.

## 37.4 Test Fixtures

Test fixtures SHOULD include complete record graphs rather than isolated JSON objects. At minimum, a fixture for delegated action should include an agent, version, deployment, relationships, assurance, parent and child delegations, status, policy, and expected decision receipt.

---

# 38. Deployment Patterns

## 38.1 Centralized Authoritative Registry

A single operator maintains authoritative records and exposes replicated read services. This pattern is simple to operate but requires strong audit, role separation, recovery, and governance safeguards.

## 38.2 Consortium Registry

Multiple institutions jointly govern admission or critical state transitions. Threshold authorization and shared transparency mechanisms can reduce unilateral control, while governance complexity and availability requirements increase.

## 38.3 Ledger- or Transparency-Backed Registry

Critical events and commitments are recorded in an append-only verifiable system, while structured records and protected evidence remain off the log. This pattern can improve equivocation detection without forcing all data into a public ledger.

## 38.4 Federated Domain Registries

Domain-specific registries retain local governance and exchange records through explicit recognition. This is the RECOMMENDED pattern for cross-sector or cross-jurisdiction deployment because global resolution does not require global governance.

## 38.5 Enterprise Private Registry

An organization operates a registry for internal agents and selectively exposes externally relevant identity, assurance, or authority records. Private deployment does not remove the need for typed relationships, lifecycle history, or enforcement integration.

## 38.6 Hybrid Public-Private Registry

Public identity, governance, status commitments, and endpoints are combined with protected delegation, assurance evidence, and execution records. This pattern supports accountability while limiting disclosure.

## 38.7 Profile Examples

| Profile | Representative Deployment |
| --- | --- |
| A | Public directory of low-risk research agents |
| B | Enterprise registry for data-access and workflow agents |
| C | Procurement network with bounded transactional delegation |
| D | Public-service, healthcare, financial, legal, or fiduciary agent infrastructure |

# 39. Operational Guidance

## 39.1 Recommended Service Decomposition

A production deployment SHOULD consider separate services for:

- identity and record management;
- relationship management;
- delegation and authority;
- assurance;
- status;
- search and indexing;
- event publication;
- evidence storage;
- governance and appeals;
- policy evaluation;
- federation; and
- audit.

## 39.2 Deployment Modes

Supported modes MAY include:

- centralized authoritative registry;
- replicated registry;
- consortium registry;
- ledger-backed registry;
- transparency-log-backed registry;
- federated registry network; and
- hybrid public-private registry.

## 39.3 Registry Operator Separation

High-assurance deployments SHOULD separate the registry operator from at least one of:

- governance authority;
- assurance provider;
- appeal authority;
- evidence auditor; or
- transparency witness.

## 39.4 Operational Runbooks

Operators MUST maintain runbooks for:

- key compromise;
- false registration;
- unauthorized transfer;
- stale projection;
- event delivery failure;
- authority revocation;
- assurance invalidation;
- data breach;
- federation conflict;
- governance emergency;
- recovery; and
- public communication.

## 39.5 Service-Level Objectives

Registries SHOULD publish objectives for:

- query availability;
- write availability;
- status freshness;
- event latency;
- revocation propagation;
- incident acknowledgement;
- appeal acknowledgement;
- point-in-time resolution; and
- evidence retrieval.

## 39.6 Testing

Implementations MUST test:

- legal lifecycle transitions;
- illegal lifecycle transitions;
- delegation narrowing;
- cascade revocation;
- stale-data rejection;
- conflicting status;
- point-in-time resolution;
- key rotation;
- recovery;
- extension handling;
- event replay;
- projection reconciliation;
- federation withdrawal; and
- appeal restoration.

# 39A. Informative ARPA–TRQP Query Projection

This section is informative. It documents an interoperability boundary for architects and designers; it does not modify the normative core of ARPA or the Trust Registry Query Protocol (TRQP).

## 39A.1 Layering

ARPA governs the creation, evaluation, lifecycle, evidence, revocation, enforcement, federation, and redress of agent authority state. TRQP is treated as an external read-only query interface capable of exposing selected authorization and recognition answers derived from authoritative state.

```text
ARPA authority-control plane
        |
        v
Governed query projection
        |
        v
TRQP authorization or recognition response
```

ARPA conformance does not imply TRQP conformance. TRQP conformance does not imply ARPA conformance. Projection support MUST be separately versioned and declared under ARPA-CAND-011.

## 39A.2 Projection safety

A projection adapter MUST preserve action, resource, context, validity, recognition scope, prohibitions, and evidence provenance. It MUST NOT broaden delegated or recognized scope, infer transitive recognition, equate technical federation with governance recognition, or convert missing, stale, conflicting, suspended, revoked, expired, or unavailable authority into an affirmative result.

The detailed, machine-verifiable mapping is defined by `mappings/trqp-arpa-query-projection.yaml`. The architecture rationale, information-loss analysis, and sequence diagrams are defined by `docs/architecture/trqp-arpa-interoperability.md`.

## 39A.3 Lifecycle ownership

ARPA owns the operations and evidence through which authority state changes. A TRQP projection queries the resulting state; it is not an ARPA lifecycle API and does not add write operations to TRQP. Discovery metadata for a projection endpoint is an optional ARPA interoperability declaration and MUST NOT be presented as a mandatory registry-of-registries mechanism.

# 40. Open Issues

The following topics require further community specification and implementation feedback:

1. canonical default identifier method;
2. mandatory proof suites and canonicalization;
3. standard capability taxonomies;
4. assurance-control catalogs and assessor accreditation;
5. selective-disclosure and privacy-preserving status formats;
6. interoperable policy languages;
7. execution and decision receipt proof formats;
8. federation discovery and recognition exchange;
9. revocation acknowledgement across heterogeneous enforcement points;
10. conflict resolution across governance domains;
11. self-modifying and continuously learning agents;
12. ephemeral sub-agents and agent swarms;
13. shared runtimes and multi-tenant isolation;
14. model-provider and tool-provider accountability;
15. liability, indemnity, insurance, and bonding metadata;
16. jurisdictional conflict and mandatory local rules;
17. evidentiary admissibility and long-term verification;
18. post-quantum migration;
19. emergency governance abuse prevention;
20. measurement of effective revocation convergence; and
21. interoperability with sector-specific registries and trust infrastructures.

# 41. IANA Considerations

This document requests future registration, if standardized, of:

- the `agentreg` URI scheme;
- the `application/agent-registry+json` media type;
- a registry of Agent Registry record types;
- a registry of Agent Registry event types;
- a registry of lifecycle reason codes;
- a registry of conformance profile identifiers; and
- a registry of extension namespaces.

This draft does not make an immediate IANA request.

# Appendix F. Privacy Patterns

## F.1 Public Pointer, Protected Record

Publish status, issuer, digest, and access method while keeping the complete record access-controlled.

## F.2 Selective Attribute Proof

Prove a policy-relevant property, such as sufficient authority or assurance, without disclosing the complete source record.

## F.3 Pairwise Identifier

Use a relationship- or domain-specific identifier to reduce cross-context correlation while retaining protected accountability linkage.

## F.4 Confidential Authority Evaluation

Return a signed decision receipt showing that an action was evaluated against current authority without revealing unrelated delegation terms.

## F.5 Confidential Evidence Package

Store detailed execution evidence with an evidence custodian and issue scoped access grants for audit, investigation, or appeal.

## F.6 Privacy-Preserving Status

Permit a verifier to determine that no disqualifying status applies without exposing unrelated incident or identity information.

# Appendix G. Design Rationale

## G.1 Why a Directory Is Insufficient

A directory answers where an agent can be found and how it describes itself. Delegated action requires answers about legitimacy, scope, accountability, and remedy.

## G.2 Why Identity and Delegation Are Separate

Identity is persistent. Delegation is contextual and time-bounded. Combining them causes authority to survive changes in principal, purpose, operator, or control.

## G.3 Why Ownership Is Not Central

Agents may be developed, published, deployed, operated, controlled, sponsored, and legally backed by different entities. A single ownership field obscures the actual accountability graph.

## G.4 Why Status Is Multi-Dimensional

An agent can be registered but offline, authorized but uninsured, operational but under investigation, or assured but no longer delegated. A single active/inactive flag cannot represent these states safely.

## G.5 Why Assurance Is Not Universal Trust

Assurance is always about a defined subject, scope, control set, evaluator, time, and limitation. It cannot establish suitability for every purpose.

## G.6 Why Point-in-Time Resolution Is Required

Disputes concern the state that applied when an action occurred, not merely the current state.

## G.7 Why Revocation Requires Enforcement

A registry can declare that authority no longer exists, but an agent may still retain active credentials, sessions, or runtime access. Effective revocation requires operational convergence.

## G.8 Why Federation Requires Recognition

Technical interoperability does not create institutional legitimacy. Registries need explicit rules for whose records, decisions, and assurance claims they accept.

## G.9 Why Redress Is a Protocol Concern

For consequential agents, the ability to challenge, correct, suspend, restore, and repair is part of system correctness. It cannot be left as an undocumented external process.

## G.10 Central Theory

The central architectural proposition of this specification is:

> **An agent registry should not be designed as a directory of autonomous software objects. It should be designed as a distributed authority-control plane for delegated action.**

A conforming registry therefore exists not merely to make agents visible, but to make their identity, authority, assurance, operation, accountability, and contestability machine-resolvable.

# Appendix H. Change Log

## H.0 Version 0.9.0

- Promoted the document to the authoritative Candidate Specification.
- Added stable Candidate requirement identifiers and independent conformance targets.
- Hardened delegation, recognition, lifecycle, durable-event, proof, policy, and evidence semantics.
- Added the informative ARPA–TRQP governed query-projection boundary.
- Required machine-verifiable requirement-to-test-to-evidence traceability.

## H.2 Version 0.5.0

- Added composable protocol modules, ARPA-Core profile, identifier/alias and Agent Card profiles.
- Added normative OpenAPI/event contracts, controlled registries, completed schemas and reference implementation.
- Added multidimensional conformance evidence, extended governance vectors, end-to-end scenarios and deployment guidance.

## H.1 Version 0.3.0

- Attributed the specification to a named author.
- Added an ABNF grammar for the `agentreg` identifier scheme (§12.2).
- Named JCS (RFC 8785) as the default record canonicalization method, with a profile-declared override (§13.2).
- Defined the relationship between the document version and the record `schema_version` track (§33.1).
- Added an HTTP status code mapping for `ARPA-*` error codes (§34.3).
- Corrected Appendix G subsection numbering (previously mislabeled `F.1`–`F.10`).
- Cited BCP 14 (RFC 2119, RFC 8174) for the normative requirements keywords.
- Published JSON Schema (2020-12) definitions for all fourteen record families under `schemas/`, with a shared record envelope.
- Published one valid and one invalid machine-validated example per record family under `examples/`, plus a validation script (`scripts/validate_examples.py`).
- Published conformance test vectors and profile matrices for all four conformance profiles under `conformance/`, each with at least one granting and one blocking test case, plus a reference evaluator and test-vector runner (`scripts/reference_evaluator.py`, `scripts/validate_test_vectors.py`).
- Wired schema and conformance validation into repository CI.

## H.2 Version 0.2.0

- Reorganized the specification into context, architecture, normative protocol, cross-cutting requirements, and conformance parts.
- Added a detailed problem statement and requirement-to-failure-mode mapping.
- Added representative use cases and end-to-end protocol flows.
- Added explicit trust, issuer-competence, projection, enforcement, and governance boundaries.
- Added registration, version, deployment, and relationship-management sections.
- Added normative authority-evaluation, reliance-evaluation, status-precedence, material-change, point-in-time, conflict, and revocation processing rules.
- Added privacy architecture and reusable privacy patterns.

- Clarified the distinction between registry resolution, policy decision, and runtime enforcement.

## H.3 Version 0.1.0

- Established the initial architecture, record model, lifecycle model, protocol endpoints, security considerations, and four conformance profiles.

# End of Candidate Specification

# 42. Protocol Modules and Implementation Contracts

## 42.1 Composable modules

ARPA defines `ARPA-Core`, `ARPA-Relations`, `ARPA-Assurance`, `ARPA-Authority`, `ARPA-Evidence`, and `ARPA-Federation`. A conforming deployment MUST declare supported modules. Support for a lower module MUST NOT be interpreted as support for a higher module. The normative dependency and non-implication rules are specified in `docs/protocol-modules.md`.

## 42.2 Core implementation profile

A Profile A implementation MUST satisfy `spec/profiles/arpa-core-identity-discovery-profile.md`. It MAY omit authority, assurance, evidence and federation operations, but MUST return `ARPA-OP-NOT-SUPPORTED` rather than an affirmative or ambiguous result.

## 42.3 Machine-readable contracts

The JSON Schemas, controlled registries, OpenAPI contract, event contract and conformance vectors in this repository are normative implementation artifacts for v0.5.0. Where prose and a machine-readable artifact conflict, an implementation MUST report the conflict; neither form silently overrides the other until corrected through governance.

## 42.4 External descriptions

External Agent Cards and equivalent descriptions are discovery inputs. Their claims are self-declared unless independently verified. Capability description MUST NOT become capability authorization or delegated authority by import.

## 42.5 Conformance evidence

Conformance claims MUST identify protocol, semantic, cryptographic, operational, governance and enforcement dimensions. An implementation report MUST state unsupported dimensions and known limitations.
